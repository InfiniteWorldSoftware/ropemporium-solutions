# Forrest Bushstone's ROPEmporium solutions/fails

I am teaching myself return oriented programming (ROP) attacks. Each directory contained herein contains the actual binary, a file called "exploit" that can be used to exploit the binary by running `binary < exploit`, and a simple Perl script that can be used to generate these exploits (it also holds the addresses in readable, little endian form) called "exploit_string.sh".

Also, some directories may contain a subdirectory called "fails" which contain some of my failures- if anyone finds it useful for learning, feel free to take a look and learn from my mistakes rather than just outright cheating and looking at the solution.
